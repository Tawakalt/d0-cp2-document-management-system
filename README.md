# A Document management System

- This repository contains a working solution to a document management system, complete with roles and privileges. Each document defines access rights; the document defines which roles can access it. Also, each document specifies the date it was published. Users are categorized by roles. Each user must have a role defined for them. 
- The application has the following features;
  signup
  Login/Logout
  Create Roles, Users and Documents
  Update Users and Documents
  Delete Users and Documents
  Search for Users and Documents  
- The API Documentation can be found [here](https://d0-cp2-document-management-sys.herokuapp.com/).
